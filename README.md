# Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning Summer School 2019

This repository contains my (highly crude) notes taken during the Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning Summer School organized by [CIFAR](https://www.cifar.ca/) and [Amii](https://www.amii.ca/) in Edmonton, Alberta in the summer of 2019. 

**Disclaimer:** This is by no means aimed to replace the lecture videos or slides. It is rather a brief overview of the materials covered throughout the Summer School.
